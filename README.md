# trippy_trees
Animated visualization of fall leaves using object-oriented programming in Processing

----

## Inspiration

On a recent trip to my alma mater, I was inspired by the amount of life in the Arboretum, and decided to create an animated visualization of a breathing autumn landscape.

I used object-oriented programming to create animated mathematical functions resulting in a rhythm of colors and pulses for the trees, moon, and land.

## To Install & View Locally:

1. This project uses <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing 3</a>, which is a programming language for creating visual art and prototypes and all that jazz. Before you begin, <a href="https://processing.org/download/">download Processing 3</a> on your computer.

2. Download this repo on your local computer.

   (If you rename any folders or files, make sure the main folder matches the name of the main .pde file. For mine, they're named trippy_trees and trippy_trees.pde respectively.)

3. Open trippy_trees/trippy_trees.pde (with Processing 3).

3. Press play. That's it!
